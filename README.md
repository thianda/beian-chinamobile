### beian-chinamobile

A tampermonkey script for `beian.chinamobile.com`

Beautify the web UI, simplify the functions. Do less, work out more!

> The original page of the website is ugly, and it is very cumbersome to use. Every submission sends POST requests to refresh the entire web page. It's awful. And even different functions are on different pages, jumping back and forth is just like gas to explode! Fortunately, we have this one, it is based on tampermonkey, which is simplified, single page, more focused and more efficient.
